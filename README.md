Methods for Evaluating Process Model Search
==========

Process model search has received significant interest in the scientific community recently, due to its precursory role for process model reuse. An abundance of diverse techniques has been proposed, yet few of them have been evaluated thoroughly, and a commonly agreed evaluation method is missing.

Based on a literature review, we present measures and methods for evaluating the quality and performance of process model search techniques, and discuss their relevance and suitability by a case study. This work aims at improving the the analysis of future techniques and comparability between them.

This repository provides [implementations](https://github.com/mtkunze/evaluation/tree/master/src/de/uni_potsdam/hpi/bpt/search/evaluation) for various process model search evaluation criteria.
